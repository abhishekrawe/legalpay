# 🐸Problem Statement and my approach (अप्रोच्‌)🐸

1️⃣. Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password. Use
static id or pass. (If credentials are store in database is adding
extra points).

- User Can Create Account with name , email , password and reEnter Password

2️⃣. Login using their id and password.
- User Can login with email id and Password

3️⃣. Now if login was successful the user will be able to do the following:
1) Withdraw money.
2) Deposit money.
4) Quit the program.

- After succesfully Login with same email and password that you had register with , a Home page will show 
- where user can withdraw Money , Deposit there money and check there remaing Ballence also and Exit Button too return back to login Page.
- You can see here 👇

📌if you face any issue in register you can use this email - any@gmail.com and Password - 1234
 - there are some issue on Alert message after deployment on register page it will not show you succesfully created account 
   you can simple login with that register email passowrd it works well .. i will fixed this issue .
