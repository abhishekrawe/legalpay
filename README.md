# 🐸Problem Statement and my approach (अप्रोच्‌)🐸

1️⃣. Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password. Use
static id or pass. (If credentials are store in database is adding
extra points).

- User Can Create Account with name , email , password and reEnter Password

2️⃣. Login using their id and password.
- User Can login with email id and Password

3️⃣. Now if login was successful the user will be able to do the following:
1) Withdraw money.
2) Deposit money.
4) Quit the program.
