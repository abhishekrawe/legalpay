# 🐸Problem Statement and my approach (अप्रोच्‌)🐸

1️⃣. Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password. Use
static id or pass. (If credentials are store in database is adding
extra points).

- User Can Create Account with name , email , password and reEnter Password

📌if you face any issue in register you can use this email - any@gmail.com and Password - 1234
 - there are some issue on Alert message after deployment on register page it will not show you succesfully created account 
   you can simple login with that register email passowrd it works well .. i will fixed this issue .
